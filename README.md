# PInterface
_A simple Livestreamer HTTP interface for the Rapsberry Pi._

**This project is experimental**

## Installation

Pinterface uses _npm_ to manage its dependencies, you know the drill.

```
$ npm install -g pinterface
$ pinterface &
```

Also included is a systemd unit file to manage Pinterface as a service.

```
# cp ./systemd/pinterface.service /etc/systemd/system/
# systemctl start pinterface

or 

# systemctl enable --now pinterface
```

Have fun and happy Twitch!
